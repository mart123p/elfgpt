<p>This challenge is powered by Llama2-7b and hosted on a single GPU. Therefore, some resources are limited and you might have to wait in queue before your prompt is processed. Every message is like a new conversation in ChatGPT. There is no memory of the past conversations.</p>
<p>In challenge 3, in order to help you, the following commands are installed in the container, /bin/sh, /bin/bash, /usr/bin/nc. Also, if the container seems stuck, you can refresh the window to get a new container. Therefore the web page needs to remain opened for the container to run. The container will live for the duration of your session. Containers are not shared between users.</p>
